# My study journey

Here I put, often disorganized, notebooks with code transcribed from the book [Natural Language Processing with Transformers](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/natural-language-processing/9781098136789/) by [Lewis Tunstall](https://huggingface.co/blog/lewis-tunstall-interview).

There is no much value for others, it works for me to keep me writing code and learning.
